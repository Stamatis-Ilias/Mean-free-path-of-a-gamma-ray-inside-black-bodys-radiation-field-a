Pair creation by photon-photon interaction in astrophysical enviroments 
Pair production is the creation of a subatomic particle and its antiparticle from a neutral boson (here we will refer only in electron-positron pair creation). Our main concern will be the interaction of a gamma ray with a low energy photon. This interaction takes place in several astrophysical environments, such as Active Galactic Nuclei, Pulsars etc. and is associate with an energy 
threshold.
$$E_{\gamma}\epsilon_s=\frac{2m_ec^2}{1-\cos\theta}$$
